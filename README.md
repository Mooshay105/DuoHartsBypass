# Duolingo Harts Bypass

## How it works:

It looks for the following elements and removes them when added to the page:
A `<div>` with the "\_1yFTM \_3fFQQ FohH5" classes.
A `<div>` with the "\_3Mzt6" class.
A `<svg>` with the "\_9ePF4 \_1tbIe" classes and a `<rect>` inside with "\_3s5cy iRKce" classes.

# How to fix:

Add server side checks.
